	<p><strong>GRT</strong> was created as a way to help dogs.  You hear stories all the time about owners having to give up their dogs because they are "untrainable" or "bad dogs."  We don't believe that is necessary.</p>
	
    <p>At GRT, our mission is to help every dog that we come in contact with.  We know the techniques to use to encourage that light bulb moment to go off in your pets head and we do so within their own environment.  Both of our trainers, Drew and Nate, taught their furry friends the exact techniques and skills tha we teach to your dogs.  We work one-on-one with both you and your pet and show you exactly how to continue training on your own.  Once we are a part of you and your pets' lives, we are there to stay!</p>
	
	<p>We are excited for the opportunity to work with you and your dog to provide the support for a well behaved canine using our force-free methods.  We take your trust in us seriously and look forward to booking time with you!</p>
